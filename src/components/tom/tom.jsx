        Tom, named &quot;Jasper&quot; in his debut appearance, is a gray and
        white domestic shorthair cat üêà. &quot;Tom&quot; is a generic name for a
        male cat. He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a
        comfortable, or even pampered life. Tom is no match for Jerry&apos;s
        wits.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl my-1">
        Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom
        to actually try to eat Jerry. He tries to hurt or compete with him just
        to taunt Jerry, even as revenge, or to obtain a reward from a human,
        including his owner(s)/master(s), for catching Jerry, or for generally
        doing his job well as a house cat. By the final &quot;fade-out&quot; of
        each cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.
