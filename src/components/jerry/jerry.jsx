        Jerry üêÄ, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in his debut
        appearance, is a small, brown house mouse who always lives in close
        proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much
        larger, Tom is no match for Jerry&apos;s wits. Jerry possesses
        surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of
        Tom&apos;s, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and
        withstanding considerable impacts.

      <p className="text-xl my-1">
        Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom
        to actually try to eat Jerry. He tries to hurt or compete with him just
        to taunt Jerry, even as revenge, or to obtain a reward from a human,
        including his owner(s)/master(s), for catching Jerry, or for generally
        doing his job well as a house cat. By the final &quot;fade-out&quot; of
        each cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.
